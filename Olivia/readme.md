# Olivia DATASET folder

### Folder Structure:

```
Parent Folder:
    - Scripts and Notebooks
    - Folder: Extract
    - Folder: images
    - Folder: jsons
    - Folder: outputs
```

Within the 'Olivia' folder, create two subfolders: "jsons" and "images". Copy and paste any JSON files that need analysis to the former folder. Any other folders are created automatically.

The "Extract" folder stores the different boxes and point clouds associated with said bounding boxes after running extract.ipynb\
The "outputs" folder stores the output from running copod.ipynb and any results from collect.ipynb.\
The "images" folder serves as a storage place for any graphs generated by the notebook.

Run the notebooks in the following order:
-extract.ipynb\
-collectgrtuth.ipynb\
-copod_x.ipynb\
-analyze_x.ipynb

Use visualize.ipynb to visualize individual bounding boxes.
