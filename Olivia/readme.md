# Olivia DATASET folder

### Folder Structure:

Parent Folder:
    - Scripts and Notebooks
    - Folder: Extract
    - Folder: images
    - Folder: jsons
    - Folder: outputs

Inside the Olivia Folder create the "jsons" and "images" folders. Copy and paste any JSONs that need analysis to the "jsons" folder. The other folders store different outputs and are created automatically.

Extract stores the different boxes and point clouds associated with said bounding boxes after running extract.ipynb
Outputs stores the output from running the copod.ipynb notebook and the result of the collect.ipynb notebook.
Images serves as a manual storage for any graphs generated by the notebook.

Run the notebooks in the following order:
extract.ipynb
collectgrtuth.ipynb
copod_x.ipynb
analyze_x.ipynb

visualize.ipynb serves to visualize individual bounding boxes both individually and in the context of the wider point cloud.
